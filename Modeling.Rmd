##### Compartments

The model represents a randomly selected part from a spherical cell body with a radius of 5 \(\mu\)m. The approximate pyramid shape implies that the model geometry and its exact location in the cell minimally affect the simulation results. The base of the pyramid represents the cell membrane and the tip represents the center of the nucleus. The model consists of three compartments: the nanodomain, the cytosol and the nucleus. The compartments are built with one or more cubes and cascaded together to approximate a pyramid geometry. The approximation is necessary because the parallel side surfaces of cubes are essential for periodic boundary conditions.<br> 


##### Boundary conditions   

Considering that the model represents a randomly selected sample from the cell body, we intended to construct the side surfaces as periodic in order to simulate a homogenous surroundings within the cell. However periodic boundaries are typically defined for parallel surfaces. We attempted to adapt the pyramid geomtry with cubes layered together, so that the nonparallel side surfaces can be approximated with sets of short parallel surfaces with varying between-panel distances. The setup works fine for single molecules, but not for complexes. The varying between-panel distances leads to changing inter-subunits distances in a complex, if the subunits hit the boundaries with different periodic rules. These theoretical difficulties impede us from impelementing periodic boundaries, therefore we choose all side surfaces and the cell membrane to be reflective.<br>
 
In addition, surfaces that are "inside" and connect between compartments are either transmittent or reflective, dependning on molecules. For example, the surface between the cytosol and the nucleus is reflective to \(\beta\)CaMKII but transmittent to all other molecules[ref].<br>

##### Molecules and reactions

We focus on modeling how Ca^2^ ions enter the cell from the L-type Ca^2+^ channels, being taken up by calmodulin(CaM), forming a complex and then binding with \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\)CaMKIIs. Major players in the model include Ca^2+^, CaM, \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\)CaMKIIs. CaM has been reported as highly concentrated in the nanodomain near the Ca^2+^ channels [ref]. We added membrane-attached neurogranin(Ng) in the nanodomain to bind with apoCaMs therefore to keep the nanodomain CaM at a mM level. Upon Ca^2+^ ions flow in, the bound apoCaMs can be released from Ng to react with Ca^2+^.<br>

CaMKIIs are modeled as a 6-subunits ring complex. This is simplified from its original 12-subunits structure which contains two layered 6-subunits rings. We believe that a 6-subunits ring is a fair approximation in terms capturing the dynamics among subunits. Reaction stages for a single subunit include Ca^2+^-CaM binding, autophosphorylation at Thr286, trapping of Ca^2+^-CaM and dephosphorylation. In particualr, a CaMKII subunit can bind with CaMs loaded varying number of Ca^2+^s.<br>

We assume that \(\beta\)CaMKIIs follow the reaction stages as above described. For \(\gamma\)CaMKIIs, the intraholoenzyme autophosphorylation is reported to be slow [ref]. Instead, it was suggested that more often \(\gamma\)CaMKII sunbts get phosphorylated by \(\beta\)CaMKIIs[ref]. We included this intraholoenzyme interactions in the model.<br>

##### Initial condition and Simulation
The model starts with steady-state concentration levels of Ca^2+^, CaM and CaMKIIs in different compartments so that thereâ€™s no fluxes of free Ca^2+^ and CaM between compartments [table 1].  Concentration values were calculated using COPASI.<br>

Simulation timestep

To decided an appropriate time step, we followed the suggestions by Smoldyn user manuel. Let k be the forward reaction rate constant of the fastest first order reaction in the model, the time step should be less than 1/k. With our model, the k is 160 ms^-1^. The time step should be less than 0.00652 ms. To ensure a moderate simulation speed, we choose a time step of 0.001 ms.<br>
