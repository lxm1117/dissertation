#### Reaction network

The chemical reactions included in the network are all elementary reactions, or single-step reactions. Reaction orders are defined by the number of reactants involved. For example, two reactants binding is a second order reaction. The corresponding unbinding reaction is first order. In the reactions network, only first and second order reactions are included. All reactions are described at the single molecule level. For complex holoenzymes that consist of multiple subunits, reactions apply for the individual subunits. When building the reaction network, Ca^2+^, calmodulin, neurogranin are modeled as single subunit molecules. CaMKIIs are modeled as 6-subunits complex. 

One purpose to model CaMKIIs as complex molecules is to capture its detailed interactions with calmodulin and its dynamics with neighbor subunits. Previous experiment studies have shown that CaMKIIs exihibit complicated activation phases depending on the binding state with calmodulin and Ca^2+^. Their intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation also allows cooperativity among subunits, enabling CaMKII to code a Ca^2+^ influx pattern to the downstream signaling cascades in a frequency-dependent manner. Each CaMKII subunit can undergo 4 general activity states: bound with Ca^2+^-CaM, phosphorylated at Thr286, bound and phosphorylated, and neither bound nor phosphorylated. When consider the subunits of a complex collectively, there comes a problem to enumerate all possible combinations of different subunit states. The number of possible combinations increases rapidly with the number of total subunits and the level of details included for a single subunit activity states. For a 6-subunit complex, assuming each subunit has 4 states, there are 3 possible ways that 2 subunits get bound, 4 possible ways for 3 bound, and 3 possible ways for 2 bound. A similar pattern applies to describe phosphorylation states. When consideirng binding and phosphoryaltion together, however, the situation becomes more intricated. Ignoring the graph characteristics among subunits and the interdependency between states, a rough way to estimate the total possible combinations is number of states^number of subunits^. This gives an overestimation because the graph property of the ring structure leads to redundant combinations. But it generally shows the combanitoric complexity of subunit states.               

Our initial approach was to treat a complex as an entity. Then different combinations of subunit states are considered as different molecule species. Reactions are described at the level of a complex, ignoring how individual subunits interact. BioNetGen was used to expand the whole network before simulation running and then feed into Smoldyn as a separate file. A few problems arise with this approach. The first is a computational bottleneck. A CaMKII complex was modeled with 6 subunits and each contains 4 states. On a desktop with 16 CPUs at 3.40GHz, it takes BioNetGen 9 hours to generate the network, which contains total 1401 species and 721105 reactions. Reading the network file to Smoldyn took another approxiamtely 2 hours. When further subunits states were added, for example more binding states between CaMKII and CaM, the network size became unmanagbly huge and it took more than 24 hours to generate. A second issue regards to a hidden assumption that within a single time step, only one subunit is allowed to react, given that reactions are all elementary.     


* Assumptions of chemical reactions, at what levels chemical reactions are described?
* Why model molecules in terms of holoenzyme complex?
* Reaction types:  
    a -> b  
    a + b -> c  
    c->a + b  
    [reaction condition]
* Principles of reactions:  
    reactions are defined at a subunit level;  
    molecule connections are preserved.
