#### Reaction building

* Assumptions of chemical reactions, at what levels chemical reactions are described?
* Why model molecules in terms of holoenzyme complex?
* Reaction types:  
    a -> b  
    a + b -> c  
    c->a + b  
    [reaction condition]
* Principles of reactions:
    reactions are defined at a subunit level;
    molecule connections are preserved.
