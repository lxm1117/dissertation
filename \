#### Reaction network

The chemical reactions included in the network are all elementary reactions, or single-step reactions. Reaction orders are defined by the number of reactants involved. For example, two reactants binding is considered as second order reaction. The conrresponding unbinding reversal reaction is considered as first order.  In the reactions network, only first and second order reactions are included. All reactions are described at the single molecule level. For complex holoenzymes that consist of multiple subunits, reactions apply for the individual subunits. When building the reaction network, Ca^2+^, calmodulin, neurogranin are modeled as single subunit molecules. CaMKIIs are modeled as 6-subunits complex. 

The decision to model CaMKIIs as complex molecules, for one consideration, is to capture its detailed interactions with calmodulin and its dynamics with neighbor subunits. Previous experiment studies have shown that CaMKIIs exihibit complicated activation phases depending on the binding with calmodulin and Ca^2+^. Their intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation also allow cooperativity among subunits, enabling CaMKII to code a Ca^2+^ input pattern to the downstream signaling cascades in a frequency-dependent manner. Each CaMKII subunit can undergo 4 broad activity states: bound with Ca^2+^-CaM, phosphorylated at Thr286, bound and phosphorylated, and neither bound nor phosphorylated.     

* Assumptions of chemical reactions, at what levels chemical reactions are described?
* Why model molecules in terms of holoenzyme complex?
* Reaction types:  
    a -> b  
    a + b -> c  
    c->a + b  
    [reaction condition]
* Principles of reactions:  
    reactions are defined at a subunit level;  
    molecule connections are preserved.
